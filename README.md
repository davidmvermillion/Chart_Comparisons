# Chart_Comparisons
This project compares charts of a simple dataset across programs while showing the work required to obtain the charts. This is a personal project to obtain the initial charts and coding. All rights are reserved until then. After I am satisfied with my project, I will open it up with a license for distribution and welcome expanded contributions. I expect the initial phase of the project to be completed by the end of September 2020. [2020 0726]
