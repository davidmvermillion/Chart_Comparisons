# Chart_Comparisons
This project compares charts of a simple dataset across programs while showing the work required to obtain the charts. This is a personal project to obtain the initial charts and coding. The end-goal is to have steps laid out for all listed programs for both relatively default graphs, and then a consistent style-guide across the same swath of programs. All rights are reserved until then. After I am satisfied with my project, I will open it up with a license for distribution and welcome expanded contributions.

Eventually two working documents (default and style-guide) along with two presentation-ready documents of the same will be made (with vastly different presentations). Think working thought-dump and polished presentation for comparing the two. I expect the initial phase of the project to be completed by the end of October 2020. [2020 0811]
